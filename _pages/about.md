I am currently pursuing my PhD at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) where I am a Research Assistant at Wireless Innovation Laboratory under Dr. Alexander Wyglinski. My research interests include Cognitive Radios, Dynamic Spectrum Access, Bio-inspired Spectrum Access Techniques, Vehicular Communication. In past I have worked as an Automotive Engineer at Robert Bosch designing where my main responsibilities included designing .hex codes for North American OEM. I was also a Teaching Assistant at WPI for ECE introduction course and my responsibilities include assisting students in their projects and helping them in Lab.


**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
