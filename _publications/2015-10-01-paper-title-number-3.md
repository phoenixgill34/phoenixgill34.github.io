Normalized energy detection is used for spectrum sensing due to its low implementation complexity. The proposed heterogeneous spectrum sensing test-bed is implemented using USRP N210s and RTL-SDRs within a controlled indoor laboratory environment. All signal processing is performed using GNU-Radio and post processing is conducted using MATLAB. Sensor units (SUs) are designed to generate the local test statistic L and transmit it to a Fusion Center for decision making. The Fusion Center (FC) is a base station that decides whether signal is present or not based on the data from all sensor units. We implement both soft and hard data fusion techniques and compare their performance in a practical fading channel scenario.
